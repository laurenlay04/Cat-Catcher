# 🐱 Cat Catcher Game

**Cat Catcher** is a simple 2D Unity game where objects fall from the sky and my cat sprite tries to catch them. Depending on the type of object, your cat can **gain or lose points**. Pizza = 1 point and Egg = -1 point.
This project demonstrates basic game mechanics, scoring logic, and Unity 2D skills.
